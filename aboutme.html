          I'm Mellany Ona, a rising senior at Centreville High School located in Clifton, Virginia.
          My love for science and technology flourished when I was about 7 years old.
          I used to go stargazing with my family and ever since then I loved science.
          Whether it was Physics, Biology, Chemistry, or my new found love, Computer Science, 
          science will always be my safe haven. Hopefully I will be able to pusue my childhood
          dream of studying science in the future.</p>
